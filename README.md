This proactive system utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze user behavior within government systems and predict any attempts to leak data before they occur. It creates a data flow fingerprint for each user, detects anomalous patterns in real time, and then documents sensitive events using blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering. The concept offers an innovative approach that combines early prediction, artificial intelligence, and blockchain in a single platform to protect government data with high efficiency.
